## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Bruno Silva-Cubillos

I am a Computer Science student from Montreal, currently studying at Lasalle College. I am passionate to bring an advancement to our technology with my skills and to create new contacts with likeminded individuals. I am an adept at using Java, C#, Python, and Swift. I have knowledge in Cloudbase databases such as Firebase and am currently looking into AWS to expand my skill range.
